# Channel Bonding Feature Plan

## Overview
The channel bonding feature will enable the application to combine multiple internet connections to increase speed, reliability, and reduce latency. This feature is crucial for users needing stable and high-speed connections, especially in environments with fluctuating network conditions.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Connection Bonding**: Implement logic to combine bandwidth from multiple network interfaces (e.g., Wi-Fi, Ethernet, USB tethering).
2. **Seamless Failover**: Automatically switch to the most stable connection if one interface fails.
3. **Traffic Optimization**: Distribute data across available interfaces to maximize throughput and minimize latency.
4. **Connection Health Monitoring**: Continuously monitor each interface's health and performance metrics.
5. **User Configuration**: Allow users to prioritize interfaces and set bonding policies.

### Integration Points
- **NetworkManager.swift**: Extend to support multiple active connections with bonding capabilities.
- **NetworkBondUI.swift**: Update UI to display bonding status and configuration options.
- **NetworkMonitor.swift**: Enhance monitoring to track each bonded interface's performance.

## Architecture

### Components
1. **BondManager**
   - Handles interface aggregation and failover logic.
   - Monitors connection health and adjusts traffic distribution dynamically.

2. **BondedConnection**
   - Represents an aggregated connection combining multiple interfaces.
   - Manages data distribution and ensures seamless failover.

3. **BondingConfiguration**
   - Stores user preferences for interface priority and bonding policies.
   - Validates configurations to ensure optimal performance.

### Data Flow
1. **Interface Monitoring**: NetworkMonitor collects real-time data on each interface.
2. **BondManager Decision Making**: Uses collected data to adjust traffic distribution and failover.
3. **UI Updates**: NetworkBondUI reflects current bonding status and configuration options.

## UI/UX Design

### User Interface
- **Bonding Status**: Visual representation of active interfaces and overall connection health.
- **Configuration Panel**: Allows users to set interface priorities and bonding modes.
- **Real-time Metrics**: Display performance metrics for each interface.

### User Experience
- **Seamless Transitions**: Automatic failover should be invisible to the user.
- **Intuitive Configuration**: Make bonding settings easy to understand and adjust.
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Provide clear notifications for connection changes.

## Testing Plan

### Unit Tests
- Test BondManager logic for interface aggregation and failover.
- Validate BondedConnection data distribution under various conditions.

### Integration Tests
- Simulate network failures to test failover mechanisms.
- Measure throughput with different traffic optimization strategies.

### User Testing
- Gather feedback on UI intuitiveness and performance.
- Test bonding configuration options under real-world conditions.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Smart Traffic Optimization**: Implement machine learning to optimize traffic distribution based on historical data.
2. **Advanced Configuration**: Add support for custom bonding policies and interface weighting.
3. **Cross-Platform Support**: Extend bonding functionality to other operating systems.

## Conclusion
The channel bonding feature will significantly enhance the application's network reliability and performance. By following this plan, we ensure a robust implementation that meets user needs and integrates smoothly with existing systems.
