# Zippy Wishlist: Production Readiness

This document outlines a wishlist of features and improvements to enhance the Zippy application for production readiness. Each item includes detailed implementation guidelines to facilitate development.

## Error Handling and Logging

* **TODO:** Implement comprehensive error handling with structured JSON logging.
    * **Implementation Guidelines:**
        1. Use a structured JSON format for log messages, including timestamps, error codes, severity levels, and relevant contextual information.
        2. Implement error handling for all functions and methods, providing informative error messages and appropriate fallback mechanisms.
        3. Consider using a dedicated logging framework (e.g., `os.log` on Apple platforms) for efficient and structured logging.
        4. Ensure that logs are written to a central location for easy monitoring and analysis.

* **TODO:** Implement automatic retries with exponential backoff for transient failures.
    * **Implementation Guidelines:**
        1. Identify transient failures (e.g., temporary network issues, server timeouts).
        2. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff and jitter to avoid overwhelming the system during outages.
        3. Set appropriate retry limits to prevent infinite retry loops.

## Parameter Validation

* **TODO:** Add formal parameter validation using type hints and runtime checks.
    * **Implementation Guidelines:**
        1. Use type hints to specify the expected types for function parameters.
        2. Implement runtime checks to validate parameter values and throw exceptions or return errors for invalid input.
        3. Provide detailed and informative error messages that clearly explain the validation failure.

## Performance Instrumentation

* **TODO:** Integrate performance instrumentation to measure latency percentiles, error rates, and resource utilization.
    * **Implementation Guidelines:**
        1. Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) such as latency, error rates, CPU usage, memory usage, and network throughput.
        2. Use appropriate tools and libraries (e.g., Instruments on Apple platforms, Prometheus) to collect performance data.
        3. Implement logging and reporting mechanisms to track KPIs over time.

## Security Hardening

* **TODO:** Implement input sanitization to prevent security vulnerabilities.
    * **Implementation Guidelines:**
        1. Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
        2. Use appropriate escaping techniques for different contexts (e.g., HTML escaping, URL encoding).

* **TODO:** Apply the principle of least privilege to restrict access to sensitive resources.
    * **Implementation Guidelines:**
        1. Minimize the privileges granted to each component or user.
        2. Use access control lists (ACLs) or other mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive data and functionality.

* **TODO:** Consider encryption at rest and in transit for sensitive data.
    * **Implementation Guidelines:**
        1. Use appropriate encryption algorithms and libraries to protect sensitive data at rest and in transit.
        2. Implement secure key management practices.

## Concurrency Control

* **TODO:** Analyze code for thread safety and implement appropriate concurrency controls.
    * **Implementation Guidelines:**
        1. Identify potential race conditions and deadlocks in the code.
        2. Use appropriate concurrency control mechanisms (e.g., locks, semaphores, dispatch queues) to synchronize access to shared resources.
        3. Conduct thorough testing to ensure thread safety.

## API Versioning

* **TODO:** Implement versioned API interfaces to ensure backward compatibility.
    * **Implementation Guidelines:**
        1. Use version numbers in API URLs or headers.
        2. Maintain backward compatibility for older API versions.
        3. Provide clear documentation for API versioning and deprecation policies.

## Testing

* **TODO:** Implement automated fault injection testing scenarios.
    * **Implementation Guidelines:**
        1. Identify potential failure points in the application.
        2. Use fault injection tools or libraries to simulate various failure scenarios (e.g., network partitions, disk failures).
        3. Test the application's resilience to these failures.

* **TODO:** Conduct property-based testing with 100% branch coverage.
    * **Implementation Guidelines:**
        1. Use property-based testing frameworks to generate random test cases and verify that the application behaves correctly for all inputs.
        2. Aim for 100% branch coverage to ensure that all code paths are tested.

* **TODO:** Use mocking frameworks for external dependencies to facilitate unit testing.
    * **Implementation Guidelines:**
        1. Use mocking frameworks to create mock objects for external dependencies (e.g., databases, APIs).
        2. Test individual components in isolation without relying on external systems.

## Documentation

* **TODO:** Add detailed docstrings to all functions and methods.
    * **Implementation Guidelines:**
        1. Follow the Google Python Style Guide (or equivalent for Swift) for docstring formatting.
        2. Include clear descriptions of function parameters, return values, and potential exceptions.
        3. Provide usage examples in docstrings.

* **TODO:** Create companion documentation covering architectural decision records, failure recovery playbooks, horizontal scaling procedures, and A/B testing rollout strategies.
    * **Implementation Guidelines:**
        1. Document architectural decisions, including rationale and alternatives considered.
        2. Create detailed failure recovery playbooks to guide incident response.
        3. Document horizontal scaling procedures to handle increased load.
        4. Document A/B testing rollout strategies for new features.

## Maintainability

* **TODO:** Enforce strict abstraction boundaries and deterministic build processes.
    * **Implementation Guidelines:**
        1. Use clear and well-defined interfaces between components.
        2. Ensure that build processes are reproducible and consistent.

* **TODO:** Use dependency version pinning to ensure consistent builds.

        1. Specify exact versions for all dependencies in the project's configuration file.

* **TODO:** Implement automated tech debt tracking.
    * **Implementation Guidelines:**
        1. Use static analysis tools or other methods to identify and track technical debt.

## Security

* **TODO:** Integrate static analysis tools into the CI/CD pipeline.
    * **Implementation Guidelines:**
        1. Configure static analysis tools to run automatically during the build process.

* **TODO:** Implement mitigations for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
    * **Implementation Guidelines:**
        1. Review the OWASP Top 10 list and implement appropriate mitigations for each vulnerability.

* **TODO:** Consider cryptographic module certification.
    * **Implementation Guidelines:**

        1. Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks in the application.
        2. Focus on optimizing areas that meet SLO violation criteria.

## GitOps Practices

* **TODO:** Follow GitOps practices with atomic commits, signed tags, and bisectable history.
    * **Implementation Guidelines:**
        1. Make small, atomic commits with clear and descriptive messages.
        2. Use signed tags for releases.
        3. Ensure that the Git history is bisectable to facilitate debugging and rollback.
